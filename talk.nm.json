I call proof-by-example and say it's unsatisfying. I for one took longer to take up clojure because the syntax was so different from what I was used to (although homeoiconicity is neat), and the fact that haskell's and elm's syntaxes are so different has been a pretty big deterrant for me from getting started there too! Also OCaml's syntax, my goodness. Although I eventually braved those waters to the point where I can reasonably write OCaml (btw I do think it's objectively worse).",

                  "content": "I'd like to chime in and say that even though I prefer ML syntax, as someone who works in a JS environment with a dozen JS devs, the decision to go JS-like syntax is the right one. I've had my coworkers, who are interested in FP, look at my reason code as well as examples from y'all, and the ML syntax does seem like a hurdle for adoption. Telling them that it's changing to be more JS-like put their minds at ease, and it made it far easier to show them how cool the typesystem is and the sort of things  you can do with it. \n\nWe have bi-weekly programming workshops at my job, and I was going to do a Reason demo once the syntax changes. I'm confident a familiar syntax will allow them to see the advantages as opposed to getting hung up on that one detail. And I guarantee they would get hung up on it, haha. People say don't judge a book by its cover (syntax), but that's totally what people do, at least initially. Reason with a JS-like syntax has the potential to blow all the major competition out of the water. Y'all are gunna end up killing Typescript and Flow (never particularly liked either of them, so I'm fine with that).\nOh and I was totally one of those people who came barging into this community demanding the syntax be left alone :joy: Y'all won me over",
